# Global Beer Trends: Demographic Analysis and Flavor Evolution Across Continents - WEBPAGE

## Introduction

A fancy introduction to what our project is based on. Beer analysis over time etc... 

## Data analysis

Explanation of the two beer datasets: BeerAdvocate and RateBeer.

* Users
* Breweries
* Beers
* Ratings

What each data has and how we have processed them to leave them in a clean and common datasets. 

## Global trend analyses

Timeline analysis of preferred beer during the years. Some kind of interactive plot in which user can select region (world, USA, for example) and year and a world map that shows the data. 

We can use Vittoria's plots as base and use that data to keep updating the world map. 

Then provide the characteristics of each top beer per country or state in US case. 

## Sentiment analysis of reviews

More common tokens for the top beers. See if there is some kind of relation between the reviews to see if users give similar words. 

Maybe we can find some kind of trend to what makes the best beers the best. 

## Conclusions
